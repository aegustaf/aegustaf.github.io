                        <h3>The Start of It All</h3>
                        <p>Eric's Nut Butters is a family business that started with the
                            Gustafson family's wish for no artificial ingredients in their
                            favorite foods. 
                            
                            The Gustafson family moves a lot and every time they move
                            they must find their new go-to products in the grocery store
                            because they change by region of the country.  They had just
                            moved to Charlotte and could not find the brand of peanut
                            butter that they usually got that didn't have added ingredients.
                            
                            After trying option after option and feeling as though none of
                            the peanut butters would ever hit the mark, Eric decided to try
                            his hand at making his own peanut butter for the family.  He
                            took his food processor and a lot of peanuts and made peanut
                            butter.

                        <h3>More Than Just Peanut Butter</h3>
                        <p>Eric's Nut Butters aims to go where peanut butter never dared to
                            go before....beyond the peanut.  Eric is dedicated to providing
                            his delicious butters to those who have peanut allergies and those
                            who desire another kind of nut experience.  With hard work and
                            determination Eric and the Gustafsons have expanded beyond 
                            peanut butter and offer: almond butter, cashew butter, walnut
                            butter, and Macadamia Nut butter.
